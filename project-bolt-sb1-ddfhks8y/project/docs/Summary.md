 We've been working on building the "Curmunchkins Mystery Box Explorer," a phygital storytelling application designed for neurodivergent children.

So far, we have:

Reviewed the detailed product requirements and technical specifications for the application, focusing on its core mission, neurodivergent-first design principles, and key integrations like ElevenLabs and Algorand.
Resolved initial setup issues, including an npm install error related to the Algorand SDK package and a vite command not found error during npm run dev.
The .env file was updated by you.
Most recently, we completed "Step 5: Set Up Zustand State Management." This involved creating and populating the voiceStore, blockchainStore, and index stores, which now include detailed character voice profiles for all Munchie characters, a child-safe app-managed wallet for blockchain interactions, and comprehensive error handling.
The next step in our plan is to configure React Router and build the foundational layout components for the application.
